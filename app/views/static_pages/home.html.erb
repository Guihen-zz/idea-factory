  <h1>Welcome to Idea Factory</h1>
  
  <p>Imagine your startup full of creative people, but with lack of resources to implement all their great ideas by themselves. Collaborators should have a way to write down and share their thoughts on new apps to build.</p>

  <p>That's why we brought to you <%= link_to "Idea", :ideas %> Factory. We truly hope you enjoy it!</p>
 
  <%= link_to "Share your idea!", :ideas,    class: 'btn btn-primary' %>

	<%= link_to "Start a project!", :projects, class: 'btn btn-default' %>
  <% else %>
	<%= link_to 'Sign up', :new_user_registration, class: 'btn btn-default'  %>
